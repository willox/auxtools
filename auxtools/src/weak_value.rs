/// A weak reference to some datum or atom in the game.
///
/// Normal [`Value`]s are not safe to move between threads.
/// Using methods like [`Value::set`] or [`Value::call`] can at best cause
/// undefined behavior, at worst crash the server.
///
/// A way to bypass that limitation is to store a raw value
/// and use [`Value::from_raw`] on the main thread to actually work
/// with it. However, if that [`Value`] is deleted, your stored value
/// will point to another datum or to simply nothing.
///
/// This struct serves to solve the latter problem. You can use
/// [`Value::as_weak`] to create a weak reference to it.
/// The reference can be stored in global structures or passed to
/// other threads. You can then return it to the main thread as needed,
/// and call [`WeakValue::upgrade`] to turn it back into a real [`Value`].
/// If the datum pointed to was deleted in the meantime, `upgrade` will
/// return None, otherwise you get your datum back.
///
/// However, this struct is not entirely thread safe, since you can
/// [`WeakValue::upgrade`] on another thread and invoke undefined behavior with
/// the resulting [`Value`]. So, don't do that.
///
/// Using this struct requires all datums to have a `__auxtools_weakref_id`
/// variable.
///
/// # Example
/// ```ignore
/// let weakref = thing.as_weak()?;
/// callbacks.set(some_id, weakref);
///
/// ... some proc calls later ...
///
/// let weakref = callbacks.get(some_id);
/// if let Some(thing) = weakref.upgrade() {
/// 		thing.call("callback", &[])?;
/// }
/// ```
